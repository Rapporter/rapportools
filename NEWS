rapportools 1.0 (2014-01-07)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Initial CRAN release by moving helper functions from the "rappor" package.

At the same time, some minor and major changes were also done in the package:

 * removed the `rp` prefix for all functions -- with backward compatibility
 * overwriting default min/max/mean etc. functions instead of providing some lame mock names
 * remove the 1D limit of the above functions
 * doc review
 * code cleanup
 * more insane file structure
 * R CMD check compatibility
